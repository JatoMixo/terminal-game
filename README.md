# Simple Terminal Game

A simple terminal game I started to learn C. For now it's just gonna be some sort
of game engine for the terminal because i still don't have a real idea for the game.

## Working with the project

There's a guide on how to use git [here](./docs/using-git.md).

There's a simple Makefile for working with the project. It's very simple
and it has the following options:

- `make build`: Build the program with options for debugging.
- `make debug`: Build with options for debugging and start GDB.
- `make release`: Build the release version with maximum optimization.
- `make run`: Build the program and run it.
